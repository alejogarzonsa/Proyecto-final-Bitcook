    <h1>Fritanga</h1>
    <p>Fritanga is a fusion between our indigenous roots and the new traditions acquired in the colony. It stands as the precursor of fast foods with all its history and tradition. It is a dish made up of a variety of pork-based products, such as red sausage, sausage, short ribs and stuffed meat, accompanied by Creole potatoes, ripe bananas and chili peppers.</p>
